## Data Preprocessing
Before performing any analysis, several preprocessing steps were conducted to clean and prepare the data:

- **Missing Values Handling**: Missing values in categorical columns were replaced with 'Unknown'. Numeric columns had missing values imputed using the median.
- **Date Parsing**: Any columns containing dates were parsed and converted into datetime objects.
- **Standardization**: Numerical data was standardized to ensure that features are on the same scale before applying clustering algorithms.

## Clustering Analysis
To uncover patterns in the data, we performed K-Means clustering on the dataset. The number of clusters was set to 3 based on prior understanding.
